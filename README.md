# vector-calculator



This application is a linear algebra calculator that will be able to perform basic operations on 
vectors such as addition, subtraction, dot product, cross product and modulus. It will also calculate the distance
 between lines, planes and points, as well as find the angles between lines and planes. 
 
 My target audience for this app are people who are learning linear algebra who don't know how to use matlab.  Doing 
 such calculations by hand are mundane, time-consuming and are often sources of error, so using this app would help.                                                                                                       error, so I wanted to make a tool that makes doing assignments faster and easier.Users can
 Users can simply input their vectors, lines and planes (in parametric form) and choose the operation they want to do.
 Users can also save and load a history of past operations done using the calculator so they can refer to their results
  at a later time.
 
 The project is made with java, the GUI was implemented with java swing, and the history function makes use of the json.
 The model and persistence portion of the code has full test coverage. 
  
 This project is interesting to me because linear algebra is a weaker subject for m. I hope I can gain a deeper 
 understanding of the subject through this project and improve on this deficiency. I also wanted to make a tool that
 was somewhat technical and relevant to my subject of study so I can use it for my resume. Finally, there is an 
 element of practicality to this project, so I hope in the future some students may find it useful for when they are
 studying linear algebra.
